JavaScript for the LBUSD school choice websites. Constrained by the requirement that everything is in one file.

This project dynamically accesses data from Google Sheets, as those spreadsheets are updated over time by teachers and school administrators. For information on the initial data transfer involved in the creation of those spreadsheets, see [socscrapecontent](https://github.com/petervdonovan/socscrapecontent/) and [mastersheet](https://github.com/petervdonovan/mastersheet/)
